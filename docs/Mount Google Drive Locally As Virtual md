# Mount Google Drive Locally As Virtual File System Using Rclone


List available google drives:

rclone listremotes


Create a mount point to mount your google drive files:

$ mkdir ~/drive

Then, mount the Google drive using command:

$ rclone mount mygoogledrive: ~/drive/

You can mount a specific directory/file from the google drive like below.

$ rclone mount remote:path/to/files /path/to/local/mount

To unmount, simply press "CTRL+c" to stop the mount.

In my case, I mounted my Google drive in a mount point directory named "~/drive". Replace remote name (i.e mygoogledrive) and mount point name (i.e ~/drive) with your own values.


# Custom:

rclone mount --daemon Diba_Lab_Shared_GDrive: /home/halechr/cloud/GDrive_Diba_Shared

rclone mount --daemon Diba_Lab_UMich_Dropbox: /home/halechr/cloud/Dropbox_Diba_Shared

rclone mount --daemon Pho_Personal_Dropbox: /home/halechr/cloud/Dropbox_Personal



# Force unmount:
The umount operation may fail, for example when the mount point is busy. When that happens, you can stop the mount manually using command:

$ fusermount -u ~/drive


mount_cloud_drive () {
    local remote="$1"
    local mount_location="$2"
    if mountpoint -q "$mount_location"; then
        return 0
        # echo "The mount point is already mounted: $mount_location"
    else
        mkdir -p "$mount_location"
        rclone mount --daemon "$remote" "$mount_location"
    fi
}

unmount_cloud_drive () {
    # Force unmount:
    # The umount operation may fail, for example when the mount point is busy. When that happens, you can stop the mount manually using command:
    local mount_location="$1"
    fusermount -u "$mount_location"
}
